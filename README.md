We are using Last User in the order for Team and User Analysis. There are around 6k orders in 18 months which had sub category of Internal Review and Client Activity. All the orders have initially processed by PIC users and transferred to OM users. Added the users list in the example sheet for these 6k orders.

Added order count for sub orders type TTD charts. Majority of the orders belong to Standard Order sub type.

Added the last data until September 2023

Created count views for MAXX attributes (Op control Function, System Category). Used only top 15 categories for system category. These Attributes donâ€™t show differentiation between SCS and CRD Rules.

Working on to add TTD and Average Frequency count for CRD and SCS Rules.
